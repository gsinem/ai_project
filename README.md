#  Pathfinding Algorithms: A* vs Dijkstra Smart Route Navigator

This project implements and compares two fundamental graph search algorithms ‚Äî **A\*** and **Dijkstra's Algorithm** ‚Äî using an interactive **map interface**.  
Users can select start, end, and waypoint nodes directly on the map and see real-time pathfinding results along with detailed performance comparisons.

##  Features
- **Interactive Map:** Select nodes (e.g., Cafes, Libraries, Museums).
- **A\* and Dijkstra Algorithms:** Choose between two search strategies.
- **Real-time Calculation:** Displays path, total distance, and travel time.
- **Waypoint Support:** A\* ensures waypoints are visited.
- **Performance Comparison Panel:** Highlights algorithm differences.
- **Local Storage:** Saves selections between sessions.

## üìö Technologies Used
- HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript 
- Leaflet.js 

  

## ‚ö° Algorithms Explained

### A* Algorithm
- Combines **actual cost** and **estimated cost to goal** using the **Haversine formula**.
- Optimized for **speed and efficiency** on large maps.

### Dijkstra's Algorithm
- Finds the **shortest path** without using a heuristic.
- Slower compared to A* in large graphs but always finds the optimal path.
